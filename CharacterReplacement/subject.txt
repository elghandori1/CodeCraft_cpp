Project Name: Character Replacement in a String

Description:
This C++ program allows the user to replace all occurrences of a specified character in a string with another character.
The program first prompts the user to input a string, then asks for the character to replace and the replacement character.
After processing the string, it outputs the modified string if changes were made or informs the user if no modifications were necessary.
